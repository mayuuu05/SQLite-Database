# Flutter Quotes App with SQLite

## Overview

This Flutter application allows users to manage a collection of quotes by adding, displaying, and deleting them using a local SQLite database. The app features a clean and responsive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with their quotes.

## Features

- **SQLite Database Integration**: The app uses SQLite to store quotes locally on the device. The database is managed through a `DbHelper` class, ensuring efficient data handling.
- **Add Quotes**: Users can add new quotes by entering the quote text, author, and category. The quotes are saved to the SQLite database and immediately reflected in the UI.
- **View Quotes**: All stored quotes are displayed in a scrollable list. Each item shows the quote text, author, and category, with the ability to delete individual quotes.
- **Delete Quotes**: Users can delete quotes from the database. A confirmation dialog ensures that quotes are not deleted accidentally.
